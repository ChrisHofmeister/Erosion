# Erosion
A 2-d game where you shift earth tiles of varying resistances around a grid to help guide the path of an eroding river.
The goal is to ensure enough fertile soil tiles have not been eroded once the river reaches the end of the board but are adjacent to the river, thus ensuring plans can grow.
